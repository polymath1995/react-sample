Hi WeInvest buddies..!

I have completed both portfolio assignment and bootstrap challenge tasks.

1. Portfolio Assignment : 
    An application was created with the stacks of react, redux, router, sass, bootstrap and webpack.
    This app is hosted on github.
    You can find the online working demo here,             
    https://polymath1995.github.io/we-invest/#/polymath1995.github.io/
    
    To Run it locally, do i) npm installl ii) npm start.. Enjoy:)

2. Bootstrap challenge : 
    It is a single html file. For your reference I have committed this file along with this project.
    file name : bootstrap-challenge.html
    file path : https://github.com/polymath1995/we-invest/blob/master/bootsrtap-challange.html
    
                                       Thank you!!!
